        dependencies from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/):
        
        ```
        pip install ESINet

        ## First steps
        
        Check out one of the [tutorials](tutorials/) to learn how to use the package:
        
        * [Base tutorial](tutorials/tutorial.ipynb): Simulate data and train a ANN to predict some sources. Shows the most important functions of this package and serves as the easiest entry point.
          
        * [Brainstorm Auditory example](tutorials/brainstorm_auditory_example.ipynb): This tutorial shows you how to use ESINet to predict the sources in word processing data. Code was partially used from the [MNE tutorials](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/sample-datasets/plot_brainstorm_auditory.html?highlight=brainstorm)

        # Workflow
        ESINet is a lightweight package that provides all building blocks to use an ANN
        to solve the EEG inverse problem. It relies on
        [mne](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html)) to handle all tasks
        related to EEG and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to create, train
        and predict with the ANN.
        
        <br/>
        
        ## The forward model
        Knowing how cerebral currents will project to the scalp electrodes requires solving the *forward problem*. Fortunately, this problem has a unique solution! We provide a function to quickly create a *forward model* which supplies all assets required for the following processing steps:
        
        ```
        pth_fwd = 'forward_models/ico3/'
        sampling = 'ico3'
        create_forward_model(pth_fwd, sampling=sampling, info=epochs.info)
        ```
        The sampling defines the number of dipoles in your source model and thereby the resolution of your inverse solution. If you don't have powerful hardware we encourage to leave the sampling at 'ico3'.
        
        <br/>
        
        ## Simulating EEG data
        ANNs that find solutions to the inverse problem need to be trained to infer the dipole moments of your source model given the EEG.
        
        You can create a set of sources using our high-level function:
        ```
        sources_sim = run_simulations(pth_fwd, durOfTrial=0)
        ```
        
        To simulate the corresponding EEG data with added noise you can use our function:
        ```
        eeg_sim = create_eeg(sources_sim, pth_fwd)
        ```
        
        You can visualize the simulated data with this code block:
        ```
        %matplotlib qt
        sample = 0  # index of the simulation
        title = f'Simulation {sample}'
        # Topographic plot
        eeg_sim[sample].average().plot_topomap([0.5])
        # Source plot
        sources_sim.plot(hemi='both', initial_time=sample, surface='white', colormap='inferno', title=title, time_viewer=False)
        ```
        
        <br/>
        
        ## Training
        Now we want to train an ANN to infer sources given EEG data. Since we have simulated all the required data already we just have to load and train a ANN model.
        
        To load our basic model:
        
        ```
        # Find out input and output dimensions based on the shape of the leadfield 
        input_dim, output_dim = load_leadfield(pth_fwd).shape
        # Initialize the artificial neural network model
        model = get_model(input_dim, output_dim)
        ```
        Next, we train the model:
        ```
        model, history = train_model(model, sources_sim, eeg_sim)
        ```
        
        You have now trained your neural network - congratulations!
        
        ## Testing the ANN
        Let's see how your ANN performs!
        First, we have to simulate some data for evaluation:
        ```
        # Simulate source
        sources_eval = run_simulations(pth_fwd, 1, durOfTrial=0)
        # Simulate corresponding EEG
        eeg_eval = create_eeg(sources_eval, pth_fwd)
        ```
        Next, we use the trained ANN model to predict the source given the EEG.
        
        ```
        # Predict
        source_predicted = predict(model, eeg_eval, pth_fwd)
        ```
        
        Now let's visualize the result:
        ```
        # Plot ground truth source...
        title = f'Ground Truth'
        sources_eval.plot(hemi='both', initial_time=0.5, surface='white', colormap='inferno', title=title, time_viewer=False)
        
        # Plot the simulated EEG
        title = f'Simulated EEG'
        eeg_eval[0].average().plot_topomap([0], title=title)
        
        # Plot the predicted source
        title = f'ConvDip Prediction'
        source_predicted.plot(hemi='both', initial_time=0.5, surface='white', colormap='inferno', title=title, time_viewer=False)
        
        ```
