# esinet: Electric source imaging using artificial neural networks (ANNs)

**esinet** let's you solve the EEG inverse problem using ANNs. It currently supports two main architectures:
## Model 1

A fully connected neural network which is trained on single time instances of M/EEG data. This model was described in our [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.569918/full).

## Model 2

A temporal long-short-term memory (LSTM) model which is trained on sequences of EEG data. A similar model only with different output specifications has been presented in a work bei [Cui et al., 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8766914?casa_token=AFbwwLcRySAAAAAA:Gx9_D5QajW1parwhStwtxPdLVVIT8WTbdzTg8bSZ1LT6mTuOTxYyLxd84Kc3k9n2fpqkL8Dl).

# Installation from PyPi
Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install esinet and all its
dependencies from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/):

```
pip install esinet
```

<br/>

# Quick start
The following code demonstrates how to use this package:

```
from esinet import Simulation, Net

# Simulate M/EEG data
settings = dict(duration_of_trial=0.2)
sim = Simulation(fwd, info, settings=settings)
sim.simulate(n_samples=10000)

# Train neural network (LSTM) on the simulated data
net = Net(fwd)
ann.fit(sim)

# Perform predictions on your data
stc = ann.predict(epochs)

```

# First steps

Check out one of the [tutorials](tutorials/) to learn how to use the package:

* [Tutorial 1](tutorials/tutorial_1.ipynb): The fastest way to get started with Model 1. This tutorial can be used as an entry point. If you want to dig deeper you should have a look at the next tutorials, too!
* [Tutorial 2](tutorials/tutorial_2.ipynb): Use esinet with low-level functions that allow for more control over your parameters with respect to simulations and training of the neural network.
* [Tutorial 3](tutorials/tutorial_3.ipynb): A demonstration of simulation parameters and how they affect the model performance.
* [Tutorial 4](tutorials/tutorial_4.ipynb): Learn to use the LSTM network (Model 2) to predict source time-series from EEG time-series.

# Troubleshooting
* Having problems with the installation? Check the [package requirements](requirements.txt)

# Notes on current version
* This version 0.1.0 is fully compatible with the mne-python package. This meant that I had to change the whole API to match the mne-python API. Please have a look at the new tutorials in order to get familiar with the new code structure or revert back to an earlier version. Check the changelog for a version list.
