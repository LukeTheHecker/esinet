# esinet: Electric source imaging using artificial neural networks (ANNs)

esinet let's you solve the EEG inverse problem using ANNs. 

It is based on our publication: [ConvDip: A Convolutional Neural Network for Better EEG Source Imaging](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.569918/full)

# Installation from PyPi
Use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install esinet and all its
dependencies from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/):

```
pip install esinet
```

<br/>

# First steps

Check out one of the [tutorials](tutorials/) to learn how to use the package:

* [Base tutorial](tutorials/tutorial.ipynb): Simulate data and train a ANN to predict some sources. Shows the most important functions of this package and serves as the easiest entry point.
  
* [Brainstorm Auditory example](tutorials/brainstorm_auditory_example.ipynb): This tutorial shows you how to use esinet to predict the sources in word processing data. Code was partially used from the [MNE tutorials](https://mne.tools/stable/auto_tutorials/sample-datasets/plot_brainstorm_auditory.html?highlight=brainstorm)
